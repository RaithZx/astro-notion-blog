---

## Executive Summary

We've implemented a **non-intrusive newsletter subscription system** for the Ligadu blog. 

**Key Point:** This is **NOT a paywall**. All content remains freely accessible. The newsletter system simply encourages readers to subscribe via gentle reminders.

## What Users See

### 1. Full Access to Content
- ✅ **All articles are free to read**
- ✅ **No restrictions or paywalls**
- ✅ **No forced registration**
- ✅ **No content blocking**

### 2. Friendly Subscription Prompts

Users are **gently reminded** to subscribe through:

#### A. Newsletter Modal (Pop-up)
A polished modal window that appears automatically at strategic moments:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Inskreve na Newsletter       [✕]  │
├────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                    │
│  [Email field]                     │
│  [Name field] (optional)           │
│  [✓] I agree to privacy policy     │
│                                    │
│  [Subscribe Button]                │
│                                    │
│  "Can cancel anytime. No spam."    │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### B. Inline Banner (In-Article)
An attractive colored banner that can be placed within or after articles:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📧  Fika ligadu      [Free Badge]  │
│                                    │
│ Get the latest articles in your    │
│ email                              │
│                                    │
│ [Email] [Subscribe Button]         │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## When Prompts Appear

### Smart Trigger System

The modal automatically appears based on user behavior:

| Trigger | When It Happens | Why This Timing |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **30-Second Timer** | After user has been on the page for 30 seconds | Shows genuine interest in content |
| **50% Article Read** | When user scrolls halfway through an article | Engaged with content, likely enjoying it |
| **Exit Intent** | When mouse moves to close the tab (desktop only) | Last chance to capture their attention |

**Important:** Only ONE trigger fires per visit. Whichever happens first wins.

## User Experience Protection

### We NEVER Annoy Users

The system includes multiple safeguards to ensure a positive experience:

✅ **Already Subscribed?**  
   → No prompts ever shown again

✅ **Closed Modal?**  
   → Won't appear again during that browsing session

✅ **Modal Already Shown?**  
   → Other triggers are disabled

✅ **Reading Content?**  
   → Never blocks or interrupts the article

✅ **Mobile Friendly**  
   → Responsive design, easy to close

✅ **Accessible**  
   → Works with screen readers, keyboard navigation

### Scenario 1: Engaged Reader
```
00:00 → User finds article via Google

00:25 → Scrolling through article
00:30 → Reaches 50% of article
        ✨ Modal appears
        
User Options:

```

### Scenario 2: Quick Visitor
```
